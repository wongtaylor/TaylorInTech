I wanted to share my experiences from college to the job hunt, to landing my first job and moving to a completely new state. Everything that I would tell my younger self about from interview prep, to networking, and other career-related topics. Especially going into a male-dominated field, I wanted to share my perspective on what it's like working in the tech industry as a woman of color.  My hope is by sharing my story that you'll find something that is helpful or relatable.

Comments are welcome! I would love to hear your thoughts and any new blog topics you would like me to write about.  

Make every day and every action intentional.

When I was in middle school, my grandma would give me cut out newspaper articles about computer science and technology. Litle did I know then that that would be the area I would earn a Bachelors degree in. My mind was set from a young age to follow in my parents footsteps and become a doctor. Why not? I loved helping people, found the body fascinating, and it didn't gross me out. I came from a family of doctors, aunt, uncle, step mom, step dad, grandma, etc. It just seemed like the natural path to take, but something drew me to take a computer programming class my sophomore year of college as an elective.

My grandma wasn't surprised to get a call from me rambling on and on about programming and how intriguing I found it. It just clicked for me and made sense, "it's basically a maze of puzzles that require creative problem solving with a mix of math, my two favorite things!" Halfway through my fall semester, I remember planning my courses if I were to change majors and still graduate in four years. Despite the program being daunting, I had to believe in myself and took a leap of faith. I was committed to graduating with a CS degree and would not let myself give up. 

Honestly, as the classes became more challenging, the more I enjoyed them and the stronger the computer science community grew. I got invovled in ACM, Association for Computing Machinery, or the "CS Club" my senior year and it was one of the best decisions I made in college. Yeah it was a lot of work, but completely worth the valueable relationships I built with my classmates, new CS students, and the professors. I could go on and on about how ACM had such a positive impact on me, but my goal in taking the leadership postion was to transform ACM into a resource for others.

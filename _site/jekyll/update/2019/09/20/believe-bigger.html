    <p>Believe Bigger.</p>

<p>The books I’ve been interested in lately include a lot of self reflection and forward thinking books, including “Believe Bigger” by Marshawn Evans Daniels.  I wanted to share my thoughts and important takeaways from these books as others may find it relatable as well.</p>

<p>In my previous post, I talked about feeling lost and unsure how to spend my extra time not spent at work. DeVon Franklin expressed that in order to become an expert in the field you want to be in, you have to prepare and study.  Ask questions, listen, and meet people.  Maximize your potential and manage your time.  One of the things I’ve asked myself for the past few years is how can I take full advantage of the opportunities around me?</p>

<p>So I asked myself, how did I want to use my time to prepare for the next big thing in my life?  Where did I want to take my career?  What are the most important aspects for a career to be satisfying and fulfilling to you?  It is important to recognize the value of what you do, who you are, and who you aspire to be.  Everyone has a gift.  A gift is what you do the absolute best with the least amount of effort.  When I first thought about what my gift was, I thought it was helping others but I realized that might be more of a passion that I want to include into my career.</p>

<p>According to CliftonStrengths, my strengths include:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Restorative: adept at dealing with problems</li>
  <li>Achiever: satisfaction in being busy and productive</li>
  <li>Positivity: contagious enthusiasm</li>
  <li>Woo: love the challenge of meeting new people and making a connection with someone</li>
  <li>Relator: enjoy close relationships with others</li>
</ol>

<p>This reminded me that I find joy by being around others and having deep connections, staying busy and upbeat, and solving problems.  Life isn’t stagnant.  We were meant to grow and continuously learn.  How can I take my strengths and use them to acheive my goals?  My first thought that I’ve been wrestling with is grad school.</p>

<p>Some colleagues recommended the Georgia Tech online program because it is convenient, doesn’t break the bank and allows me to continue to work full time in the office.  Some recommended Stanford and MIT, but studying on campus to be able to network with other classmates and get the full experience.  Others were more in favor of learning on the job and saving the money.  I love learning.  That is one thing that will never change, but there are different ways to learn other than in a classroom. I can learn from coworkers on the job, or take the initiative to do further research on my own with all the material and tools within my grasp.  All are valid options with reasonable factors to consider so I figured I would at least try and apply to the various master programs of interest and see what happens.</p>

<p>I think as people grow, goals might change or alter so it’s important to remember that you can refine your game plan.  Find a career path that will allow you to love what you do every day and grow in ways you might not have planned for.  Keep adding to your network and stay connected with the field you want to be an expert in.  Watch how trends change and overlap.  Look at set backs as set ups.</p>

<p>Kevin Hart’s “I can’t make this up: Life Lessons” talks about his dedication to be a comedian when time after time he could have given up.  Not only does he emphasize the importance of hard work and determination, but also the importance of believing in yourself.</p>

<hr />
<p>Halfway through my first computer programming class my sophomore year of college, I took a leap of faith and changed my major.  I knew that I enjoyed problem solving and despite the program being daunting, I had to believe in myself.</p>

<p>Finding a way to pursue and master that gift in a way that makes a difference in the world</p>
